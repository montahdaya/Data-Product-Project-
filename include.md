### Welcome to the Storm Database Explorer

This application is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.

Datasets have been obtained from [the Coursera Reproducible Research Course site](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) and processed as part of a peer assignment for the course.A full description of the processing workflow is available at [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/zero323/18294).

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/montahdaya/Data-Product-Project-).

You can adjust the year range and event types using control panel located on the left side. Filtered dataset can be downloaded using the Data tab.
